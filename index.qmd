I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan.

I study comparative politics and historical political economy. My research investigates the political and social mechanisms of nation-building in imperial and post-imperial contexts, with a regional focus on Japan. I am particularly interested in how the Japanese empire mobilized civilian populations to support its colonial and militarist agendasâ€”both in overseas territories such as Manchuria and in peripheral regions like Okinawa.

I received my B.A. in Liberal Arts (International Relations) from the University of Tokyo in 2024.
